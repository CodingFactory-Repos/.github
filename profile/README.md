# Welcome to the Repo of all CodingFactory projects üëè
My name is [Louis](https://github.com/Loule95450), developer at [Thales LAS](https://thalesgroup.com) and student at the [CodingFactory](https://codingfactory.fr). I offer my projects to present to companies the potential that [CodingFactory](https://codingfactory.fr) students are able to achieve. 

‚ö†Ô∏è - If you are new to the school, you don't have to do anything on this page. It's important to find the solutions to your problems on your own, no one will be able to accompany you all your life!

## You want to come to CodingFactory? üèÉ
Great news! If I managed to convince you, I'm very happy! I let you look at the next open house in Paris or Cergy on the [CodingFactory website](https://codingfactory.fr/nos-evenements/)! You'll be able to chat with students to learn more about the school!

#### Are you still a minor? üîû
You are precocious, want to start the adventure of developer sooner than expected, do what you love from your 16 years old? I redirect you to [EDENSchool](https://www.edenschool.fr/), the first and only school of web development for minors
